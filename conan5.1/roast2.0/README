Installation
     Note: This software has been tested with JDK 1.2 and 1.3 only

     1. Update the PATH and CLASSPATH variables:
          To set the PATH and CLASSPATH permanently, set them in
          your startup file.
               * For C shell (csh), edit the startup file (~/.cshrc):
                    setenv PATH <path to conan>/roast/bin:$PATH
                    setenv CLASSPATH <path to conan>/roast:$CLASSPATH
               * For ksh, bash or sh, edit the profile file (~/.profile):
                    PATH=<path to conan>/roast/bin:$PATH
                    CLASSPATH=<path to conan>/roast:$CLASSPATH
          Then load the startup file and verify that the path is set:
               * For C shell (csh):
                    % source ~/.cshrc
                    % which roast
               * For ksh, bash or sh:
                    $ . $HOME/.profile
                    $ which roast

     4. Run test scripts to verify Roast installation. 
     
          To test the Roast installation, execute:
              % cd roast/installTest
              % roast < Test.script > Test.java
              % javac Test.java
              % java Test -level 4 -logfile Test.actual
              % diff Test.actual Test.expected  
              
          To check the Roast Log Message Viewer installation, execute:
              % cd roast/installTest
              % roast < Test.script > Test.java
              % javac Test.java
              % java Test -level 4 -logfile Test.ser -serialize
              % java roast.viewer.LogViewer Test.ser
